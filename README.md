# GBIF for Biological Occurrence Data

This repo and associated blog posts ([part 1](https://medium.com/@wvsharber/introduction-to-gbif-the-global-biodiversity-information-facility-8a0ab65aae34) and [part 2](https://medium.com/@wvsharber/using-gbif-data-and-geopandas-to-plot-biodiversity-trends-6325ab6632ee)) detail how to use GBIF, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, to acquire biological occurrence data. This data consists of records of where and when organisms have been found on the planet. 

I use Python scripts in a Jupyter Notebook to make API calls to GBIF for downloading sample data, and then clean the data using Pandas, and finally make a biodiversity heatmap that shows how many species of a group of plants have been found in a given area.
